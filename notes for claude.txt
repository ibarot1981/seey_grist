Last value in Actual Emp Master: SF2796
========================================

from the excel file - MasterSalarySheet, take the following columns :
- Emp No.
- Salary Rate (Per Day)
- Emp Type : Temp / Perm
- Salary Calculation on Fixed / Hourly
- Date of Joining

Use these columns to compare grist table. grist table columns are as below (entered in the same order of excel columns.) :
- SFNo
- Salary_PerDay
- Perm_Temp
- Fixed_Hourly
- DOJ

Following scenarios to consider :
1. Emp No. does not exist in grist. In this case, enter new record by mapping excel columns to grist table.
2. Emp No. found, compare "Salary Rate (Per Day)". If rate not equal, then need to create entry in a different grist table as below :
    - Grist table name : Emp_RateLog
    - Enter the following fields in Emp_RateLog table :
        1. Emp No. which was found in "SFNo" in grist table.
        2. Salary rate from excel sheet in "NewPerDayRate" in grist table.
        3. "Remarks" in grist table to be "AutoCode"
3. Emp No. found, salary rate matched, do nothing.
